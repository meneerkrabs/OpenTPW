# Building a park together (co-op)

OpenTPW's co-op lets up to four players build one park together online. The original game had no
shared building (its online features were visits, chat parks and movement relay,
[ONLINE-FEATURES.md](reverse/ONLINE-FEATURES.md)), so everything here is an OpenTPW extension of the
online extension `opentpw.online`, labelled `[EXT:online-coop-*]` in the code. The plan with its
phases (C1 to C7) and the comparison of the architectures is in the project notes
(`plans/coop-plan.md`); this page records what is built and the decisions it rests on.

Status: phase C1, the command layer, in progress (parts 1 and 2 of 3). No session code exists yet; single player is
unchanged.

## User decisions

The user approved the co-op design on October 19, 2026 (AskUserQuestion in the main session). The
decisions as recorded in the plan's "User decisions" section:

> - Q1 architecture: "Lockstep, host ordent" (A).
> - Q6 money: "Eén gedeelde bank" (A).
> - Q7 invited player's default rights: "Host stelt per speler in" (C).
> - Q2 placement: inside opentpw.online (A).
> - Q3 parks: any of the host's own TPW parks, never TPI (A).
> - Q4 joining: both invite+code and open globe listing, host chooses per session (C).
> - Q5 players: up to 4 (B).
> - Q8 pause/speed: host only (A).
> - Q9 saves: host's slot plus a co-op copy per builder (B).
> - Q10 golden tickets/keys/unlocks: EVERYONE in the session gets them (B).
> - Q11 versions: exactly the same release (A).
> - Q12 guests: normal 1500 (A).
> - Q13 editions/languages: allowed if simulation data matches (A).
> - Q14 undo: own commands, normal refund (A).
> - Q15 browser: join AND host from the start (B in the plan's wording "A join and host"), so C1b browser bit-identity is a hard gate.
> - Q16 mods: allowed if everyone has the same simulation-changing set (A).
> - Q17 cheats: refused in a session (A).
> - Q18 host leaves: the host role moves to another player (B) — needs host migration (snapshot + frame order handover).
> - The proposed EXT labels are NOT yet individually approved; the decisions above approve the design they describe.

In English: host-sequenced lockstep (every player runs the simulation, the host orders the
commands); one shared bank; the host sets each player's rights; the feature lives in the online
extension; any of the host's own Theme Park World parks (never Theme Park Inc); invite with a code or
an open listing on the globe, chosen per session; up to four players; only the host pauses or
changes speed; the host's save plus a co-op copy for each builder; everyone in the session earns the
golden tickets, keys and unlocks; exactly the same release; the normal 1500 guests; different
editions and languages when the simulation data matches; undo of a player's own commands at the
normal refund; the browser joins and hosts from the start; the same simulation-changing mods for
everyone; cheats refused in a session; when the host leaves, the host role moves to another player.

The task that started C1 asked for the plan's proposed labels (for example
`[EXT:online-coop-commands]`) to be used; the code uses `online-coop-commands` for the command layer
and `online-coop-permissions` for the rights hook.

## The command layer (C1)

`[EXT:online-coop-commands]` Every park edit of a HUD window or tool is a serializable command
(`ParkCommand`, `source/OpenTPW/World/Commands/`) handed to the park's one funnel, `Level.Commands`
(`ParkCommands`). A command is keyed on cells, catalogue entries (their content-root key and archive
path), rotations, attraction ids and modes, never on screen positions or the camera, and it carries
the issuing player's session slot (`Player`, 0 = the local player and host).

- **Before a tick.** A command applies before simulation tick N, the next tick the fixed-step clock
  runs. In single player it runs at once in the input handler, exactly where every edit ran before
  the command layer (between two ticks, before the frame's simulation), so no single-player run and
  no determinism pin changes. `ParkCommands.Schedule` holds a command for a later tick and
  `Level.AdvanceSimulation` applies the held commands at the start of their tick: a replayed log
  uses it now, a session's lockstep frames will.
- **The executor reads no tool state.** `Level.ExecuteCommand` takes everything from the command and
  the world: the armed entry, the build angle, the Move tool's flag and the add-on ride are fields of
  the command, so the same command does the same on every peer. Presentation (the action message,
  sounds) still happens where the edit runs.
- **Multi-click tools stay local.** The path and queue tools keep their start, vertex stack and ghost
  on the issuer's machine; each committed line and each Backspace inside the tool is one command
  (`LayLineCommand`, `UndoLineCommand`) through `ParkCommandLineWriter`. The Move tool's pick-up is a
  command (`PickUpObjectCommand`) and the placement another (`PlaceObjectCommand` with `Moving`); a
  moving placement is accepted only for the entry the same player picked up, because the Move tool's
  purchase skips research and the balance test.
- **Refusals.** A command whose fields are out of range, any command in a read-only visit (economy
  commands included, closing the gap the visit's `ParkEconomy` had), and a command the player's
  rights refuse are rejected before they touch the park. A refusal changes nothing and is logged
  like an accepted command, so a replay refuses it the same way; only a malformed command, which
  has no byte form, is left out of the log.
- **Rights.** `[EXT:online-coop-permissions]` `IParkCommandRights.Allows(player, kind)` is the hook for
  the host's per-player rights (decision Q7). Only the hook exists; single player has none.
- **Nested edits.** A command whose execution issues another (a tool callback) runs that one as part
  of itself; only the outer command is logged.

### Serialization

`ParkCommandCodec` writes a command as an envelope (format version 1, the kind's tag, the player) and
its fields in declared order: integers as zigzag LEB128 varints in their shortest form, strings as a
byte length and UTF-8 (at most 512 bytes), floats by their bit pattern, cell lists as a count and
pairs (at most 4096). Coordinates are bounded by 4096 and rotations are the four build angles. The
decoder refuses truncated bytes, trailing bytes, another version, an unknown kind, a padded varint and
out-of-range fields. Kind tags are never reused or renumbered. The schema test
(`ParkCommandCodecTests`) pins the bytes of one sample of every kind; a change of any of them needs a
new format version.

### The park's settings

The HUD windows' settings are commands too (`ParkSettingsCommands.cs`, kinds 30 to 51). Economy objects are named by their
economy instance id, attractions by their attraction id, staff by their id, applicants by their candidate id and loans by
their offer index. `ParkEconomyCommands.Execute` runs them on the park's economy and checks first what the economy would
throw for, so a refusal changes nothing. The HUD sends them through `ParkHud.EditsOf(economy)`: the level's funnel when the
economy is its park's (always in a game), else a funnel over that economy alone (`ParkEconomyCommands.ForEconomy`, for a HUD
shown over an economy without its level, as tests do), which is not part of the level's log. Cheats stay commands so that a
session can refuse them (decision Q17), and the speed command is the one a session gives to its host alone (decision Q8).

### Recording and replay

`ParkCommandRecorder` (`Level.StartCommandRecording`) records every applied command with its tick and
the world hash (`WorldStateHash`) every 60 ticks. `ParkCommandLogFile` is its file: the magic
`OTPWCMDS`, the format version, the theme, the world seed, the start tick and start hash, then the
commands and checkpoints in tick order and an end mark. `ParkCommandReplay.Run` schedules a log on a
park that stands where the log started and runs it tick by tick, so each command lands where it was
recorded; `FirstMismatch` compares the checkpoints.

`ParkCommandLevelTests` runs a scripted build session (objects, the path tool with lines, undo and
cancel, path removals, Backspace, the Move tool, a sale, the remove tool and refused commands) on a
no-data level, replays its log on a twin level and finds the same hash after every tick.

### The guard

`ParkCommandLayerTests` reads the tool layer's source (the HUD, the UI, the front end and online
screens without their smoke harnesses, the tools, `Level.Input.cs` and the Theme Park Inc HUD) and
fails on a direct call of any converted park mutator. The mutators not yet converted are listed with
the part of C1 that converts them; that list may only shrink, so a converted one must move to the
guarded list.

### Converted and remaining

| Area | Commands | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Objects | place (the build tool, the Move tool, track add-ons), the remove tool, remove at a cell, sell from the object and attraction windows, the Move tool's pick-up, the bulldozer (area clear: one command per cleared cell) | converted |
| Paths and queues | path and queue lines, undo inside the tool, path and queue cell removal, Backspace over a cell, the queue edit click | converted |
| Developer prototype | place and remove the Totem | converted |
| Park settings | park open and close, ride open and close, the ride window's settings, entrance fee, prices and shop settings, loans, hire (without placement) and fire, training budget, research effort, project and workload, challenges, maintenance, ride upgrades, park and staff rename, cheats, game speed and pause | converted (part 2) |
| Tools | land, pools and waves, slides and pool attractions, kart and water tracks, coasters, staff placement and patrol areas | part 3 |

## Known limits of C1

- Wall-time updates outside the tick (`RefreshPools`, the evening, snow, the scene clock) and the body
  pose preparation after a frame's ticks are not part of a replay; C1b audits them. A replay runs one
  tick per frame, the game several, so a recording made in play must be checked against its
  checkpoints, which the log carries.
- A remote player's command will run the same presentation (the action message, sounds) as a local
  one; C3 separates the issuer's feedback from everyone's.
- The in-memory log keeps the newest 65,536 commands; a recording keeps all.
